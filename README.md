# Remoter

Remoter  - An alternative to Android AIDL for Android Remote IPC services using plain java interfaces

Remoter makes developing android **remote services** intuitive **without messing with AIDL**.

## Android IPC through AIDL

Android supports remote IPC using [AIDL](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html). This process of using "aidl" is painful and limited.

Some of the **problems and limitations of AIDL** are : 

* Unlike the intuitive way of defining an inteface defintions as an **interface**, AIDL forces you to define the interface in an "**.aidl**" file
* The .aidl file is usually in a different folder than your normal source
* You lose most of the IDE capability for the "**.aidl**" 
* You can't use an existing interface class and convert that to a remote interface -- it has to be defined seperately as ".aidl"
* Only limited predefined data types are supported in aidl
* Any custom Parcelable class that you want to pass through the interface has to be defined again as another ".aidl" file!
* No overloaded methods!- Methods with same name fail
* Can't extend an aidl with another
* Can't throw custom exceptions

## Remoter - An intuitive way for Android IPC

Remoter solves the above problems in AIDL by allowing you to define the remote interface using plain java **interface**, and implement it using plain java implementation of the interface.

All you have to do is annotate the interface using **@Remoter**


```java
@Remoter
public interface ISampleService {
    ...
}

```

* No messy **.aidl**, just plain simple **interface**
* Implement the interface directly using intuitive normal java way, instead of extending Stub
* **Fully interoperable with AIDL**. Remoter creates the same serialized data as created by AIDL, so it is fully interoperable with AIDL
* Supports more data types than AIDL, everything supported by [Parceler](https://github.com/johncarl81/parceler)
* Make an interface that extends other interfaces as @Remoter
* Interface methods can throw any exceptions. Clients will get the same exception that is thrown.
* Remoter interface can be templated
* Remoter is an **annotation processor** that generates two helper classes during build time -- a client side Proxy and a service side Stub that allows you to wrap your interface and implementation
* **Support kotlin coroutines!**


**At the client side**

* Simply wrap the binder that you got from the ServiceConnection with the autogenerated **Proxy** for your interface

```java
ISampleService sampleService = new ISampleService_Proxy( binder );

```

**At the service side**

* Wrap the implementation with the autogenerated **Stub** to covert it as a remote Binder and return that from your service

```java
Binder binder = new ISampleService_Stub( sampleServiceImpl );

```

That's it! 


**Annotations**

* **@Remoter** Annotate on an interface to make it a remote interface
	* You an also use a marker interface that can provide a list of interfaces for which to generate the Remoter Proxy/Stub classes. For this, annotate @Remoter on the marker interface and specify the list of classes for "**classesToWrap**"
	
```java
  /**
   * Example of a marker remoter interface that specifies other interfaces that should generate remoter proxy stub
   * <p>
   * In this case no proxy/stub gets generate for Marker, but it gets generated for IBaseA and IBaseB
   */
	@Remoter(classesToWrap = {IBaseA.class, IBaseB.class})
	private interface Marker {
	}
```
	
* **@ParamIn** Mark an array or Parcelable parameter as an **input only** parameter(**in** of aidl). By **default** they are **input and output** (inout of aidl)
* **@ParamOut** Mark an array or Parcelable parameter as an **output only** parameter(**out** of aidl).
* **@Oneway** Annotate on a method (in the @Remoter interface) with void return to make it an asynchronous method. 
* **@NullableType** Used to annotate a type parameter or suspend function return as nullable. See below for more details



## Kotlin Support with suspend functions

Remoter supports Kotlin interfaces with suspend functions. If your interface (marked with @Remoter) has any suspend functions, then the generated Proxy and Stub will be in Kotlin, enabling to call your remoter service method from coroutines. 

* The suspend functions will be dispatched using the [Dispatcher.IO](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-dispatchers/-i-o.html) context
* Kotlin Proxy can be created using the optional constructor that accepts [IServiceConnector](http://josesamuel.com/remoter/javadoc/remoter-builder/remoter-builder/remoter.builder/-i-service-connector/index.html)  which moves service connection to a suspendable coroutine

##### Kotlin Example

* Define interface in kotlin as suspend

```kotlin
@Remoter
interface ISampleService {

    /**
     * A suspend function which will be implemented by a service
     */
    suspend fun authenticate(userName:String, password:String) : Boolean
}

```

* Include the depednecy for RemoterBuilder to take advantage of suspended service connection

```kotlin
implementation 'com.josesamuel:remoter-builder:<VERSION>'
```

* From your coroutine, call the remote service call as follows

```kotlin

//From your coroutine context - 

//create service using serviceintent
val service = ISampleService_Proxy(context, SERVICE_INTENT)

//call the suspend function
val authenticated = service.authenticate(userName, password)

//The above call will 
 - suspend the current context
 - connect to service, 
 - make the remote call, 

 all sequentially without blocking the calling thread!
 
```

* No need to take care of service connection!
* No need to move to background thread for service call and then to main thred to update UI!



##### Notes on Kotlin support

* Add remoter-builder dependency to get support for suspendable service connection using [IServiceConnector](http://josesamuel.com/remoter/javadoc/remoter-builder/remoter-builder/remoter.builder/-i-service-connector/index.html) 
* vararg is not supported. Either use array or non suspend
* If any return is nullable type on a suspend function, explicitly mark the method with @[NullableType](https://josesamuel.com/remoter/javadoc/remoter/annotations/NullableType.html)
* If any types in a generic parameter is nullable, explicitly mnark those parameter with @[NullableType](https://josesamuel.com/remoter/javadoc/remoter/annotations/NullableType.html) optionally specifying which indexex of that type parameter are nullable



Getting Remoter
--------

Gradle dependency

```groovy
dependencies {

    implementation 'com.josesamuel:remoter-annotations:2.0.6'
    kapt 'com.josesamuel:remoter:2.0.5'
    
    
    //If using kotlin coroutines, include following 
    //to make even the service connection simpler - 
    
    implementation 'com.josesamuel:remoter-builder:2.0.6'
    
}
```
